4. **Submit a pull request** when ready

## üíª Development Workflow

### Running the Development Environment

```bash
# Start development server
npm run build

# Run in watch mode
npm run build:watch
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the library
npm run build

```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Run TypeScript type checking
npm run type-check
```

## üé® Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use **meaningful variable and function names**
- Add **JSDoc comments** for public APIs
- Prefer **functional components** with hooks
- Use **proper typing** - avoid `any` when possible

### Component Guidelines

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  children: React.ReactNode
  onClick?: () => void
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  children,
  onClick,
}) => {
  // Component implementation
}

// ‚ùå Bad
export const Button = (props: any) => {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### CSS/Tailwind Guidelines

- Use **Tailwind CSS classes** whenever possible
- Follow the **design tokens** defined in the system
- Ensure **dark mode support** for all components
- Test **responsive behavior** on different screen sizes

### File Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `Card.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`, `classNames.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase (e.g., `ButtonProps.ts`, `Theme.ts`)
- **Tests**: Same as source file with `.test.tsx` or `.spec.tsx`

## üìù Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
feat(button): add loading state to Button component

Add a loading prop to the Button component that displays a spinner
and disables the button while loading.

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(card): correct padding in dark mode

The Card component had incorrect padding in dark mode due to
missing dark: prefix on Tailwind classes.
```
